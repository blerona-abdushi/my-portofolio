    From the very first lines of HTML and CSS, I knew I had found more than just a skill â€” I had found a purpose. After completing an intensive 6-month Web Development course, where I specialized in technologies like <span className="font-semibold">React, Node.js, Express</span>, and <span className="font-semibold">PostgreSQL</span>, Iâ€™ve continued to challenge myself through real-world projects, both independently and in collaboration with a talented team.

I believe that great software is more than just clean code â€” it's about solving real problems, connecting people, and creating seamless digital experiences. Iâ€™m especially passionate about intuitive design, responsive layouts, and building websites that feel alive and interactive.
